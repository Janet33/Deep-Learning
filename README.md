# Deep-Learning

In this notebook, I perform image classifcation using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using tensorflow/keras.

The dataset worked with is. Fashion MNIST.

Fashion MNIST contains 70,000 images in 10 categories (60,000 images in training set, 10,000 in test set, with each image being a 28x28 grayscale image, and 10 label classes to predict). The images show individual articles of clothing at low resolution (28 by 28 pixels).
